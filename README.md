## Objective and Interest
A third-year Computer Science undergraduate student at Bina Nusantara University who is passionate about artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and data analysis. Has a high willingness to learn and is eager to keep skills up to date in a collaborative environment.



## Experiences (Academic and Non-Academic)
I actively participate in organization and campus activities. I am currently taking the role of Regional Secretary of HIMTI Binus @Alam Sutera, Vice Chairman (Student) for ICPC 2023 Asia Jakarta Regional Contest, and student learning mentor who teaches theoretical and practical computer science courses. The courses I taught in the mentoring sessions include Artificial Intelligence, Database Technology, Machine Learning, Speech Recognition, and Natural Language Processing. I have been receiving scholarships thrice from being a student learning mentor since the third semester. In those periods, I received an honour as the best mentor for the odd period 2022/2023. In 2023, I participated in writing a paper titled "Classifying and Predicting The Rating Sentiment of Women's E-commerce Clothing Reviews: A Comparative Study Using SVM, ANN, and BERT Models" and was given a chance to do an oral presentation on behalf of the research team at ICORIS 2023.

## Projects
### [Credit Approval Prediction Program](https://github.com/novitaaryanti/credit_approval_prediction_project#readme)
> **Highlighted Skills**:
> Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Machine Learning, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Data Structure, Object-Oriented Programming

Building a simple program combining machine learning model prediction and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python which covers the minimum requirements of a credit approval prediction program. The main goal of this project is to implement the best machine learning classification model that could predict credit approval in a simple prediction system. The dataset used for this project is called [Credit Approval](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/27/credit+approval) which was obtained from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. From the analysis, the best model for doing credit card approval prediction using the best 10 features based on the correlation is **Random Forest** with accuracy = 0.862595 and F1-score = 0.836364. Then, the model is implemented in the program.


### [Data Wrangling: Olist Marketplace Database](https://github.com/novitaaryanti/olist_marketplace_wrangling_project#readme)

[Read on Medium](https://medium.com/@novitaaryanti25/data-wrangling-project-customer-preferences-analysis-from-marketplace-564cfe24b484)

> **Highlighted Skills**:
> Python, SQL, Pandas, Data Wrangling, Data Analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Matplotlib, Business Intelligence

Analysing customer preferences from [Olist marketplace database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce/data) to obtain insights in order to improve Olist marketplace business service. The objectives which will be analysed are the top 10 best-selling product categories in the Olist marketplace, the most-used payment type for transactions in the Olist marketplace, and the names of 5 cities where most of Olist marketplace customers reside.


### [Data Wrangling & Visualization: Laptop Selling Analysis](https://github.com/novitaaryanti/laptop-selling-analysis-project#readme)

[Access Visualization on Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/novita.aryanti/viz/LaptopSellinginTokopediaJanuary2021/Dashboard1)

> **Highlighted Skills**:
> Python, Tableau, Pandas, Data Wrangling, Data Analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Business Intelligence

Implement data wrangling skills by using Python and data visualization Tableau as BI tools in order to obtain business information regarding popular laptop products based on the brand and series. The dataset used for this project is called [E-commerce Laptop Price Scraping](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/artakusuma/laptopecomercee) which was obtained from Kaggle. The highlighted steps in this project are enriching, structuring, cleaning the data, and visualizing the data. The Tableau visualization mainly shows the overall insight in January 2021. The visualization can also be filtered based on the day to gain insight into the specific date.
